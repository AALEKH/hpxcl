todo:
1. Implement device management component
	A. device management component should be able to
		1. get all devices
		2. choose which device to use
		3. run a kernel on the device
		4. transfer data between the cpu and gpu

2. Find a way to generalize cuda kernels
	A. Try to implement cuda kernels with a Template kernel class
        B. Try to use macro if that is not possible

3. Error handling
	A. handle hpx errors
	B. handle cuda errors

4. Worry about concurrency with memory transfers
   	Note: CUDA kernels are asynchronous by default

5. encapsulate cuda events and streams
